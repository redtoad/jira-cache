==========

Dump Jira issues to file and reload them without connection to the original server.

Quickstart
----------

Dump issues::

    from jira import JIRA
    from jira_cache import CachedIssues

    jira = JIRA('https://jira.atlassian.com/')
    result = jira.search_issues('project=JRA and text ~ "Python"')
    cached = CachedIssues(result)
    cached.dump(open('python-issues.json', 'w'))

Loading from file::

    from jira import JIRA
    from jira_cache import CachedIssues

    result = CachedIssues.load(open('python-issues.json'))

Installation
------------

Simply run ::

    pip install jira-cache

Contributing
------------

Please do! I would love for this to be developed further by anyone who is interested. Wherever possible, please
provide unit tests for your work (yes, this is very much a 'do as I say, not as I do' kind of moment).
Don't forget to add your name to AUTHORS.
